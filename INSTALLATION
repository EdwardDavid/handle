=== OJS PID Plugin
=== Author: Igor Leznik <ileznik@ucalgary.ca>
================================

The PID Plugin allows assigment of a PID, or Permanent IDentifier, to published
content in OJS so that it can be referred to unambiguously and statically by any
service supporting Handle PIDs, such as the Synergies Canada website
<http://www.synergiescanada.org>.

INSTALLATION

You can find your OJS version by looking in Site Administration, or by checking
the file "dbscripts/xml/version.xml".

1) Extract the plugin.
  - Enter your OJS installation directory (you should see OJS's index.php there)
  - Run (your .tar.gz filename may vary):
     tar xzf /path/to/pid-1.9.x.tar.gz -C plugins/generic
    This should create the directory plugins/generic/pid, containing the plugin
    files.

2) Register the plugin (it is probably a good idea to back up your database before doing this)
  - Enter your OJS installation directory (you should see OJS's index.php there)
  - Run: (you need PHP CLI package installed)
     php tools/upgrade.php upgrade
	
3) Apply the patch for your version of OJS.
 - Enter your OJS installation directory (you should see OJS's index.php there)
 - Depending on your version of OJS:
    OJS 2.2.x: Run "patch -p0 --dry-run < plugins/generic/pid/2.2.x.diff"
    OJS 2.3.x: Run "patch -p0 --dry-run < plugins/generic/pid/2.3.x.diff"

   If the patch is successful, run the same command again without the --dry-run
   option. If the patch fails, you will have to manually edit the files and make
   the appropriate changes
  
4) Add the new SQL table 'pid_resources' to your ojs database.
 - Enter your OJS installation directory (you should see OJS's index.php there)
 - Run: (you need PHP CLI package installed)
    php tools/dbXMLtoSQL.php execute plugins/generic/pid/schema.xml

USAGE (complete SETUP steps first)

1) Assign PIDs to all articles that have already been published.
 - Log in as a Journal Manager
 - Navigate to User Home > Journal Manager > System Plugins > Generic Plugins
 - Find the PID Plugin; click "Set PID for all Published Articles in this Journal"

2) Ensure that PIDs have been assigned.

 - Look for "Assigned PID" and ensure that there is a value.

A PID will be assigned to future articles automatically upon publication.
